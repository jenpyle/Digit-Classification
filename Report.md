# Machine Learning Project to compare digit classifications among data sets
*By Jennifer Pyle, May 14, 2020*

## Introduction

For my project, I to applied nonlinear logistic regression to train a classifier of Street View House Numbers(SVHN) data [2]. I based my project off of the NeuralNetworkClassifier from homework A4, with which I classified the MNIST data set. I chose the cropped format of the SVHN data set by the university of stanford [1] containing 32x32 images centered around a single character. Compared to the origional images, the cropped images were much less difficult to classify due to reducing the amount of the distractions on the sides. Below is the first 100 images with the target label appearing above each image.
